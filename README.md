# XMUM 201904 CST209 OOP-C++ Assignment

## 1. Write a C++ program to do the following: 
- Create an array of characters with a size of 10, and ask the user to insert characters into the array using the cin function. Each character can only be inserted once into the array.
- Ask the user to input a character to be searched in the array. The program will perform a sequential search on the array to find the character.
- Print the output if the character exists and specify the location of the character in the array; otherwise show that the character does not exist. 

[10 marks]

## 2. Write a C++ program to do the following:
- Create a vector.
- Input n numbers in the vector.
- Input key that you want to search.
- Perform sequential search to find if key is existed.
- Sort the element inside the container.
- Sort the element in the second half of the container.
- Use the following functions:
  - iterator erase(iterator it);  //function 
  - iterator erase(iterator first, iterator last); //function
  - void clear();  //function

## 3. Write a C++ program to do the following:

- Create an array of size n (where n is even).
- Print the sum of each pair of adjacent elements. 
- Prints the sum of the first and last elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-to-last, ……..etc.
- Use vector with iterator to perform the above steps.
